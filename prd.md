# PRD: Document Research Agent

**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** 2025-04-04
**Status:** Proposed
## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the Document Research Agent, an AI-powered system designed to answer user questions based *only* on the content of a specified set of documents. The agent will utilize a ReAct (Reasoning+Acting) pattern, iteratively searching within the documents using Chroma DB vector database and synthesizing answers with citations using OpenAI's `o3-mini` model. The entire workflow will be orchestrated using LangGraph.

## 2. Goals

* **Accurate Information Retrieval:** Provide users with answers derived solely from the specified documents, reducing reliance on external knowledge and potential hallucinations.
* **Verifiable Answers:** Enable users to trust the provided answers by including precise citations (text snippet, page number, filename) directly linked to the source documents.
* **Efficient Research:** Automate the process of searching through specific documents for answers to targeted questions, saving user time.
* **Controlled Scope:** Ensure the agent's responses are strictly limited to the provided document set via filename filtering.
* **Robust Operation:** Implement a controlled, iterative search process with clear termination conditions and failure modes.

## 3. User Stories

* **As a researcher,** I want to ask a question about specific documents (by filename) and get an answer synthesized *only* from those documents, along with citations showing the source text and page number, so that I can quickly find information and verify its origin.
* **As a support analyst,** I want to query internal knowledge base documents (PDFs, DOCX) for specific troubleshooting steps based on a customer issue, so that I can provide accurate, context-specific guidance faster.
* **As a legal assistant,** I want to ask questions about case files identified by name and receive answers with citations to the relevant page and text, so that I can efficiently draft summaries or find supporting evidence.

## 4. Requirements

### 4.1. Functional Requirements

**FR-1: Input Processing**
    * The agent MUST accept two inputs:
        1.  `original_query`: A string containing the user's question.
        2.  `filenames`: A list of strings, where each string is the exact filename of a document to be searched.

**FR-2: Document Indexing (Prerequisite)**
    * A Chroma DB collection MUST exist and be pre-populated.
    * Documents MUST be chunked (target: 600 characters, 200 character overlap).
    * Each indexed chunk MUST include the following metadata:
        * `text`: The text chunk.
        * `filename`: The source document filename (matching input format).
        * `page_number`: The page number where the chunk originates.
    * Each document chunk MUST have a corresponding vector embedding.

**FR-3: Core Agent Workflow (LangGraph Orchestration)**
    * The agent's workflow MUST be implemented using LangGraph.
    * The workflow MUST follow a ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) pattern.

**FR-4: Iterative Context Gathering**
    * The agent MUST iteratively attempt to gather relevant context from the specified documents.
    * **FR-4.1: Query Generation:** In each iteration, the agent MUST use `o3-mini` to generate specific keyword search queries based on the `original_query` and previously retrieved context (if any).
    * **FR-4.2: Document Retrieval (Vector Search):**
        * The agent MUST query the Chroma DB collection for semantically similar content.
        * An embedding model (e.g., `text-embedding-ada-002`) MUST be used to generate query vectors from the generated keyword queries.
        * Search results MUST be filtered to include *only* chunks matching the `filenames` provided in the input.
        * Retrieved data MUST include `text`, `page_number`, and `filename`.
    * **FR-4.3: Context Evaluation:** After retrieval, the agent MUST use `o3-mini` to evaluate if the accumulated context is sufficient to answer the `original_query`.
    * **FR-4.4: Iteration Limit:** The retrieval process (FR-4.2) MUST NOT execute more than **5 times** per input query.

**FR-5: Answer Synthesis**
    * Once the agent determines context is sufficient (or max iterations are reached), it MUST use `o3-mini` to synthesize a final answer.
    * The final answer MUST be based **strictly and exclusively** on the `retrieved_context`. The LLM must be explicitly prompted *not* to use external knowledge.

**FR-6: Citation Generation**
    * The agent MUST identify and output citations supporting its synthesized answer.
    * Each citation MUST correspond to a specific text chunk retrieved during the search process.
    * Each citation MUST include:
        * `text`: The full text content of the cited document chunk.
        * `page`: The `page_number` of the cited chunk.
        * `filename`: The `filename` of the cited chunk.

**FR-7: Output Format**
    * The agent MUST return its final result as a single JSON object.
    * The JSON object MUST contain two keys:
        * `answer`: A string containing the synthesized answer.
        * `citations`: A list of JSON objects, each representing a citation as defined in FR-6.

**FR-8: Handling Unanswerable Questions**
    * If, after the maximum iterations or based on context evaluation, the agent cannot answer the query from the provided documents, it MUST return the specific answer phrase: `"Information not found in provided documents"`.
    * In this case, the `citations` list in the output MUST be empty.

**FR-9: Error Handling**
    * The agent MUST include basic error handling for external API calls (Chroma DB, OpenAI API), such as retries for transient errors.
    * Graceful failure modes should exist for persistent API errors or configuration issues (e.g., collection not found).

### 4.2. Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR-1: Dependencies**
    * Requires access to a properly configured Chroma DB instance with indexed document chunks (as per FR-2).
    * Requires valid API credentials for the OpenAI API (`o3-mini`, embedding model).
    * Requires Python environment with `langchain`, `langgraph`, `openai`, `chromadb` libraries installed.

**NFR-2: Performance**
    * The agent should provide a response within a reasonable timeframe (exact SLO TBD, but influenced by the 5-iteration limit).

**NFR-3: Accuracy**
    * Emphasis on factual accuracy *relative to the source documents*. The agent should not introduce outside information. Citation accuracy (correct text/page/file) is critical.

## 5. Design and Workflow

The agent operates as a state machine orchestrated by LangGraph:

1.  **Initialization:** Receive `original_query` and `filenames`. Initialize state (context, iteration count=0, max_iterations=5).
2.  **Generate Search Queries:** LLM analyzes query and existing context (if any) to generate targeted keyword search queries.
3.  **Retrieve Context:** Embed generated queries. Perform vector search with Chroma DB, filtering by `filenames`. Retrieve text chunks with metadata (`page_number`, `filename`). Add unique results to state.
4.  **Grade Context:** LLM evaluates if retrieved context is sufficient to answer the original query. Decide: FINISH, CONTINUE, RETRY_GENERATION, FAIL.
5.  **Conditional Loop/Exit:**
    * If FINISH: Proceed to Answer Generation.
    * If CONTINUE/RETRY_GENERATION and `iterations < 5`: Loop back to Generate Search Queries (Step 2).
    * If FAIL or `iterations >= 5`: Proceed to Failure Handling/Final Answer Generation (likely indicating inability to answer).
6.  **Generate Final Answer:** LLM synthesizes answer *using only retrieved context*. Identifies citations.
7.  **Format Output:** Structure the answer and citations into the final JSON format.
8.  **End:** Return JSON output.

*(See Plan Specification document for detailed node/edge descriptions if needed)*

## 6. Success Metrics

* **Answer Relevance & Accuracy:** Percentage of answers rated as relevant and accurate based on the source documents (measured via human evaluation).
* **Citation Correctness:** Percentage of citations accurately pointing to the correct text snippet, page, and file.
* **Task Completion Rate:** Percentage of queries resolved with a synthesized answer vs. returning "Information not found...".
* **Average Latency:** Time taken from request to response.
* **API Call Efficiency:** Average number of search iterations per query (should be <= 5).

## 7. Open Questions / Future Considerations

* **Scalability:** Assess performance with a very large number of specified `filenames`.
* **Context Summarization:** Strategy for handling extremely large amounts of retrieved context if token limits become an issue (less likely with 5-iteration limit but possible).
* **Advanced Citation:** Explore extracting specific sub-snippets for citations instead of full chunks.
* **User Feedback Loop:** Mechanism for users to rate answer/citation quality.
* **Multi-Turn Capability:** Extend the agent to handle follow-up questions within the same document context.
* **Define "Reasonable Timeframe":** Establish specific performance SLOs for NFR-2.
* **Chroma DB Persistence:** Evaluate different persistence options (in-memory, disk-based, client-server) based on deployment needs.

## 8. Release Criteria

* All Functional Requirements (FR-1 to FR-9) implemented and demonstrably working via tests.
* Core ReAct loop (Steps 2-5 in Design) functions reliably, respecting the 5-iteration limit.
* Output JSON consistently matches the specified format (FR-7).
* Failure handling (FR-8, FR-9) behaves as expected for unanswerable queries and basic API errors.
* End-to-end tests pass for common use cases and edge cases (e.g., no documents match filter, query unanswerable).
* Code reviewed and documentation updated.
